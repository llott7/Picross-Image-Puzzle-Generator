###1. Introduction
**Purpose**

The purpose of the Software Design Document is to discuss and describe the implementation of the Picross Image Puzzle Generator as specified in the Software Requirements Document. The Picross Image Puzzle Generator is designed to allow the the user to import puzzles, scan or upload images and converts them to puzzles, exports puzzles, and provides hints to solve puzzles.

**Intended Audience**

Unlike the SRS document, which was written on a much larger and understandable scope for a wider audience, this SSD is more for those that are directly involved in the program or will be in the future. Whether it's us as developers right now or for consultants and product distribution services that might end up viewing it in the future, we're providing a general summmary of our product and how ir works, why it works, and who is likely to use it. 

**Product Scope**

The Software Design Document is meant to give the reader a more streamlined overview of how the entire product works. This is specifically targeted towards the people who are working closely on the product, which includes anyone from developers to any future distributors and so on and so forth. The Picross Image Puzzle Generator is meant to be a fun and useful program for fans of Picross to solve and create their own puzzles.

**Overview**

Our main focus when conceiving this program was to craft something that was both unique and interesting to us as developers. When you're making a program, it's all about what that program can do and what features it has and this is where we set ourselves apart from everyone else. The ability to scan a Picross puzzle and then solve or have it solved (entirely the choice of the user) is something that's unprecedented and shouldn't be taken lightly. This document is going to walk you through all aspects of our design. From the user interface to the concepts related to every one of our program's features.
 
Our project is built on an object-oriented approach with plenty of room to add and develop in the future. Given our program is entirely standalone, we don't have to worry about servers or databases and that opens up a lot of future opportunities for implementation. Whether it be porting the program over to mobile or adding things to the base desktop application, the possibilites here are plentiful.
